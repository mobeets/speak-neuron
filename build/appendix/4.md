### [4] ROC curve

A Neuron allowing perfect discrimination of the stimulus will yield an ROC plot with an area under the curve of 1.0, while the worst Neuron possible (that is, a Neuron who is no more useful than a coin flip) will yield an area under the curve of 0.5.
It took me quite a while to understand the powers of this mysterious graph.

Eventually, though, it occurred to me that no matter what Neuron you use, a criterion of 0 beeps will always yield a hit rate of 1.0 and a false alarm rate of 1.0. Similarly, at the very highest criterion the hit rate will always be 0.0 and the false alarm rate will be 0.0. This means that every ROC curve imaginable must have points at (0.0, 0.0) and at (1.0, 1.0). Consequently, the smallest area under an ROC curve is 0.5.

But why is the largest area possible 1.0? I tried to imagine what the ROC curve would look like for the sort of perfect Neuron I mentioned at the end of Experiment 3--a Neuron whose responses to the two sorts of stimuli would have no overlapping region. If this Neuron was really a perfect discriminator there'd be a criterion giving me a hit rate of 1.0 and a false alarm rate of 0.0. The ROC for this perfect Neuron, then, would have a point at (0.0, 1.0) as well as the points at (0.0, 0.0) and (1.0, 1.0). The ROC curve in this case would be a square--that is, a square with an area of 1!

This section's lack of clarity is perhaps the best evidence that the author fell short on his intention that this guide be aimed at a Neuron owner who is ignorant of mathematics. However, for those frustrated by the author's vagueness, a clarification of the author's methods for calculating discrimination is in order. Rather than attempting a clearer mathematical explanation of the author's methods myself, however, I'd prefer to recommend the reader to the professionals:

1. For a more detailed mathematical explanation of the author's use of the ROC curve in general, the author is referred to _Basic principles of ROC analysis_ [Metz CE, 1978].
2. For clearer instructions regarding finding the area under a curve, the famous Chilean botanist Lornwylder has written a very readable classic on the subject, called _The Ultimate AUC: How I Found the Area Under All My Curves and Learned to Like It_ [2015].
