### [2] Envelope's tuning curve for broccoli size

Let me explain what I mean. I started out by looking at all the responses from trials where the stimulus size was a 1 inch piece of broccoli, taking the average beep count of all those trials, and then plotting that new average value on the graph.

(For example, pretend that when I showed Envelope the 1 inch broccoli these were the beep counts I recorded: 5, 8, 9, 12, 8, 6. Then the average beep count for 1 inch broccoli is the average of those values: (5+8+9+12+8+6)/6 = 48/6 = 8 beeps per second.)

After that, I fit a line (or, a "curve") to the average beep responses--that line is the tuning curve.

In Envelope's case the tuning curve is just a straight line, but in general a Neuron might need a more complicated curve to describe his average beep responses. I recommend befriending only Neurons with linear tuning curves if possible, just because their beeps will be a bit easier to predict without the aid of a calculator.
