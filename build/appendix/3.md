### [3] Finding the best criterion

An example will make this clearer. Pretend that at the end of Experiment 3, these were Harry's beep responses that I recorded:

* blue stimuli: 12 beeps, 10 beeps, 11 beeps, 11 beeps, 6 beeps
* not-blue stimuli: 5 beeps, 13 beeps, 12 beeps, 6 beeps, 6 beeps

To explain the calculation of the various rates, I'll pick a criterion of 8 beeps and see how many trials I would guess right. If a trial has 8 beeps or more I'll guess the stimulus was blue, and if it has less than that I'll guess not-blue.

These would be my guess classifications for the responses above:

* blue stimuli: H, H, H, H, M
* not-blue stimuli: CR, FA, FA, CR, CR

So I had 4 hits (H), 1 miss (M), 3 correct rejections (CR), and 2 false alarms (FA). Now I can calculate the following rates:

* hit rate = H/(H+M) = 4/(4+1) = 4/5 = 0.8
* correct rejection rate = CR/(FA+CR) = 3/(2+3) = 3/5 = 0.6
* false alarm rate = FA/(FA+CR) = 2/(2+3) = 2/5 = 0.4
* miss rate = M/(H+M) = 1/(4+1) = 1/5 = 0.2
* accuracy rate = (H+CR)/(H+CR+FA+M) = (4+3)/(4+3+2+1) = 7/10 = 0.7 
* incorrect rate = (FA+M)/(H+CR+FA+M) = (2+1)/(4+3+2+1) = 3/10 = 0.3

In the example above, the criterion of 8 beeps gave me an accuracy rate of 0.7, or 70%. If I wanted to maximize my accuracy rate I would do these calculations for each criterion (0 beeps, 1 beep, ...) and just look for the criterion that had the highest accuracy rate.
