### [1] Envelope's response histogram

Here's an example. Pretend the results from Experiment 1 looked like this:

* Trial 1: 5 beeps
* Trial 2: 6 beeps
* Trial 3: 7 beeps
* Trial 4: 5 beeps
* Trial 5: 5 beeps
* Trial 6: 2 beeps

A histogram shows how often each response beep count happened, across all of your trials. The response "5 beeps," for example, happened in different three trials, while the responses "6 beeps," "7 beeps," and "2 beeps" each occurred only once. The histogram, then, would look like this:

A histogram is a way of displaying experiment results in a way that makes it clear which responses were the most common. In this example, it's now easy to see that 5 beeps was the most common response in the experiment, followed by 2 beeps, 6 beeps, and 7 beeps.
