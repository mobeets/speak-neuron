### A scene from my magic show

<div class="note">

ME: To explain what a Neuron's discrimination value means I won't need to use any criterion at all. But first, I'm going to need a volunteer from the audience. Anyone? Anyone? Yes, you! The lovely little Neuron at the back, with the long dendrites.

</div>

The Neuron is actually Harry, pretending to be an audience member; she now walks up onto the stage.

<div class="note">

HARRY: Hello.

ME: Welcome and hello; now what's your discrimination at blueness?

HARRY: 82%.

ME: Lovely! Just perfect. Now you're going to get to help me out with a little demonstration. I, The Magical Man Who Speaks in Beeps, am going to perform a magic trick. Stand right over there, Neuron, on the other side of the wall.

HARRY: Okay.

ME: Now, I'm going to close my eyes. _[I turn to speak to the audience:]_ Audience, while my eyes are closed I want you to show this lovely little Neuron two stimuli--first one and then the other, one of them blue and one of them not blue--in either order that you choose. We'll do this over and over again, and I think in the end you will all recognize the expected value of my magical powers. Ready?

AUDIENCE: Ready.

</div>

An audience member sitting in the front row shows Harry a yellow tennis ball (not-blue) and she beeps 6 times. Then he shows her a blue yo-yo and she beeps 8 times.

<div class="note">

ME: Hmm…I guess that the first thing you showed was not blue, but the second one was blue. 

AUDIENCE: Ooohhh…

</div>

I was correct!

The same audience member as before shows Harry a bit of twine (not-blue) and she flinches, then beeps 7 times. Then he shows her a block of blue cheese and she beeps 6 times.

<div class="note">

ME: The first one was blue, the second one was not blue.

AUDIENCE: Ahhhhh….

</div>

I was wrong!

By the end of the show, after 600 repetitions of my experiment with the audience, I've guessed correctly 492 times and incorrectly 108 times. And it turns out (magically enough) that the percentage I guessed correctly was 82%, which is exactly the lovely little Neuron's discrimination at blueness!

<div class="note">

ME: Thank you, thank you, really it's all just magic…

</div>

The audience stands and applauds politely. No hecklers tonight.

What a Neuron's discrimination value represents in general, as the scene above demonstrates, is the probability that one can correctly guess which stimuli was which after hearing the Neuron's responses. The great thing about this metric is that it doesn't measure the proportion correct using just one criterion&mdash;rather, it rates one's ability to distinguish between the stimuli using _any_ criterion*. Dayan and Abbott call a measurement like this a "criterion-free metric."

<div class="ed-note">
(*) A Neuron's discrimination value is calculated by considering the rates from all possible criteria, allowing this single value to represent a summary of one's overall performance. -WT
</div>

During my usual performances I prefer to choose a single criterion for the night for my magic, rather than relying on the law of averages as I did in the little scene I showed you above. How I choose the criterion I use varies with each audience: Some nights an audience might be skeptical of false alarm guesses, so I'll just choose the best criterion for that case; other nights the audience might prefer a high accuracy rate, and I'll choose a different criterion. But most importantly, knowing Harry's discrimination at decoding blueness allows me to grade her overall performance without regard to the criterion I choose to use on any given night.
