### Experiment 1: How to really get to know your Neuron

The next thing I did while wearing my new hat was to show Envelope a big fat piece of broccoli over and over again and count the number of times he beeped in response. Each time I showed Envelope the broccoli I made sure to show it to him for exactly the same amount of time. And to make sure he didn't look away, I simply tied him up to the leg of my kitchen table and fixed his head in place (a bit of twine and a square knot did the trick)*.

The broccoli was the stimulus in this first experiment of mine, and each time I showed my Neuron the broccoli stimulus I called it a trial. During each trial I counted the number of times my Neuron beeped in response at the sight of his broccoli. I wanted to do this right, you know, so I could rigorously prove to myself that Envelope really did beep more at broccoli.

But even before I began the trials I found myself frustrated at having to make so many more assumptions (beyond my rate coding hat) in order to start experimenting. For instance, how long should each trial last? I decided I'd show Envelope the broccoli stimulus for exactly one second, but arguably I should repeat the experiment with different trial lengths to see how that changed my results. And are Envelope's responses really only a function of the stimulus I show him? I could never be completely sure. Despite all of my best efforts to control the experiment, there was no way to guarantee that my results would ever be as conclusive as I'd like. All I could hope for in this experiment was that I'd catch at least a faint glimpse of a pattern in Envelope's language.

If you'd like to try my experiment at home on your own Neuron, here's the general recipe I settled on:

1. Tie up your Neuron.
2. Take two steps away from your Neuron, holding the stimulus where he can't see it. 
3. Show your Neuron the stimulus for exactly one second, and then count how many times he beeps during that second.
4. Put the stimulus behind your back again, and write down the number of beeps you just counted.
5. Repeat. Show the Neuron the stimulus for one more second, count the beeps, etc. The more trials the better!
