### A caution about wearing hats

When my new rate coding hat arrived in the mail I was pretty excited. But I was surprised to see that my new hat came with a caution notice. This is what it said:

<div class="note">

CAUTION: By wearing this rate coding hat, you announce to the world that you prefer to count the number of times a Neuron [beeps]. However, the wearer of this hat does not contend that a Neuron only communicates with the number of times he [beeps]; rather, by deciding to ignore a Neuron's specific [beep]-arrival times one makes an assumption to help simplify a Neuron-speak translation. It may seem optimistic (or ridiculous) to assume that just by counting beeps one can learn anything about a Neuron, but what else is one to do with his Neuron? Buy a fancier watch and put on a [sombrero]? Try to teach him English?

</div>

The note, I think, is trying to say that the hat one wears says nothing about what your Neuron is doing; a hat is worn only to make it clear what perspective the hat-wearer is taking when he tries to make more sense out of his Neuron's endless stream of beeps. Wearing a hat is just an assumption--the caution notice encouraged me to make my assumption explicit: From now on, all I care about a Neuron's speech is how many beeps it contains in a fixed amount of time.
