### Foreword ###

This guide to the language of pet Neurons was first published anonymously fourteen years ago, in 2012. Though its author has remained anonymous, we find in this now-classic text the following clues to his identity: He owns a copy of Dayan and Abbott's _Theoretical Neuroscience_; his places of residence have seen multiple large shipments sent from China. He has a familiarity with stereotypical Mexican headware, a predilection for the music of Archure, a propensity to reference Maya Angelou. He owns a dog. 

Despite these many clues we find ourselves with very few suspects. The Boogie Beep Man of Christchurch, New Zealand has denied all accusations that he might have had something to do with the authorship of this guide. Michael J. Frayn FRSL, in the Epilogue to his book _Speak After the Beep Revisited: Studies in the Art of Communicating with Avatars of Myself_, mentions that "...and I have been both disgusted and exhausted by the volume of email sent to me under the misconception that I was the author of some obscure educational comic involving a cartoon neuron and a magician."

Magician, indeed. Perhaps most perplexingly, there appears to be no record either on the Web or even in the International Magician's Registry of anyone performing as a magician under the stage name of "The Man Who Speaks in Beeps." Yet as fans of this guide will surely appreciate, if the anonymous author is not a magician then he is surely an artist: No one, in the fourteen years following the publication of _Speak Neuron_, has written quite so eloquently on the subject of understanding the language of a Neuron pet.

In this second edition of _Speak Neuron_ I have taken the liberty of updating the text for the benefit of the modern reader. In its brief history the book has had its successes but it has also seen its fair share of criticism. Some have pointed out that the author had an apparent prejudice against Neurons without eyes&mdash;that is, by depicting exclusively Neurons who encode the visual world. ("Where are all the Neurons with ears, or noses, or tongues?" one might say.) But such complaints irritate me in their irrelevance; the methods of understanding one's Neuron pet put forth in this book are hardly concerned with the particulars of the Neuron's response field.

Perhaps the most notable criticism has come from Henry "Hank" Terry of _The New Yorker_, who balked at the author's claim in the opening chapters of the guide that he had written it with the anti-mathematically-inclined Neuron pet owner in mind, pointing out in particular the section regarding ROC curves. And so, in order to guarantee that this second edition is at least slightly more accessible to the audience for whom the book was apparently intended, some adjustments have been made by my own liberty:

* the writing of this Foreword
* the addition of a few footnotes
* illustrations and updated graphs
* statements of a mathematical nature, wherever possible, have been relegated to the back of the book

The latter change has been made so that the reader may, if he so chooses, ignore the more technical details and read the text as it was intended: as a guide and not as a textbook. The majority of the mathematical content&mdash;especially the example calculations that the author performs&mdash;has been quarantined to the back of the book, just before the glossary. The references to this section in the book can be found in brackets, e.g. [1].

This content has been relocated rather than removed so that the book may still appeal to that minority still willing to perform arithmetic and understand graphs. However, in some sections (notably the section regarding discrimination) such mathematical quarantining was not feasible, as relocating the equations would seriously diminish the clarity of the story. I hope that these minor equations do not intimidate you as they appear to have intimidated Hank Terry.

Finally, please note that at times the original author reveals the extremely unsympathetic attitude with which Neuron pet owners of the 2010's treated their supposedly beloved pets. I have allowed these moments to remain in this edition purely for their historical interest.

And with these humble words, dear reader, I leave you to your reading&mdash;however momentarily. I hope that you may enjoy this second edition as much as I have, but to no greater extent than you did the first.
