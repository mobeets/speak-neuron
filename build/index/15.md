### Experiment 3: Putting a value on your Neuron's friendship

<img id="im-14" src="images/14.jpeg">

It took me five tries ordering new Neurons before I found a Neuron that seemed to beep more at blue things (I sent the others back for a refund), and that Neuron's name was Harry. I decided to repeat a variation of the tuning curve experiment on Harry, only this time I'd use stimuli varying in blueness instead of broccoli-ness.

Additionally, instead of giving each stimulus a numerical value like I did with broccoli size before, this time I pretended that each stimulus fell into only one of two categories: "blue" and "not-blue."

The experiment's results showed me how many times Harry beeped when she saw a "blue" stimulus and how many times she beeped when she saw a "not-blue" stimulus. What I was looking for was some sort of rule, something like "If I hear Harry beep more than 6 times in one second, then I can guess she's seen something really blue. Otherwise, she must have seen something not-blue." I was seeking&mdash;as I've mentioned&mdash;her magic beep count for blueness. (Envelope was not at all offended by my new friend Harry; he was happy to hang out in his cage during these experiments, beeping cheerily to himself.)

The graph I made above from Harry's results was extremely helpful, since I can see the histogram of Harry's responses to blue things as well as the histogram of her responses to not-blue things&mdash;all in one graph. (If it looks confusing, refer back to the graph I made in my first experiment.) It helped make clear just how many ways there are to interpret her beeping.

For instance, I saw that Harry always beeped less than 8 times in a second (marked by the orange line) on the not-blue trials. On the other hand, he always beeped _more_ than 5 times a second (the blue line) on the blue trials. What each of these facts gives me is a certain rule, or _criterion_, for guessing what Harry saw just by counting his beeps: If Harry beeps more than 8 times in a second I can be fairly sure he must have seen something blue, and if he beeps less than 5 times a second he must have seen something not-blue.

But what happens if she beeps somewhere in between those two values? This is the region in the graph between the orange and blue lines&mdash;possibly the most revealing part of the graph&mdash;where Harry beeped about the same number of times when she saw either type of stimuli. How ambiguous of her! On the other hand, if I had a Neuron whose responses to two different types of stimuli had no overlapping region at all, then I'd be able to draw a line right down the middle of this graph to decode that Neuron's beeps perfectly every time. (If I had found such a Neuron, believe me: Harry would be out of a job.)

Harry's beeps may encode blueness, but these results made it clear that Harry might still occasionally beep a lot when there is nothing blue, or beep very little when there is something blue. This was going to be a problem if I wanted to put on a magic show where I pretended to be able to see blue things through walls. Magicians aren't supposed to be magical on average, you know, they're supposed to be magical all the time. According to my experiment's results, if I heard Harry beep anywhere between 5 and 9 beeps I'd have no idea whether there was a blue sky outside or not.

I decided that 7 beeps in one second looked like a good criterion for deciding whether or not Harry had seen something blue. But how accurate was this criterion? And is it really the best criterion possible?* I knew that my stage name as a magician was going to be "The Man Who Speaks in Beeps", but before I started putting up advertisements for my show I wanted to pick Harry's blueness criterion more carefully.
