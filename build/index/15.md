### Experiment 3: Putting a value on your Neuron's friendship

It took me five tries ordering new Neurons before I found a Neuron that seemed to beep more at blue things (I sent the others back for a refund), and that Neuron's name was Harry. I decided to repeat a variation of Experiment 2 on Harry, only this time I'd use stimuli varying in blueness instead of broccoli-ness.

Additionally, instead of giving each stimulus a numerical value like I did with broccoli size before, this time I pretended that each stimulus fell into only one of two categories: "blue" and "not-blue."

The experiment's results showed me how many times Harry beeped when she saw a "blue" stimulus and how many times she beeped when she saw a "not-blue" stimulus. What I was looking for was some sort of rule, something like "If I hear Harry beep more than 6 times in one second, then I can guess she's seen something really blue. Otherwise, she must have seen something not-blue." I was seeking&mdash;as I've mentioned&mdash;her magic beep count for blueness. (Envelope was not at all offended by my new friend Harry; he was happy to hang out in his cage during these experiments, beeping cheerily to himself.)

The graph I made above from Harry's results was extremely helpful, since I can see the histogram of Harry's responses to blue things as well as the histogram of her responses to not-blue things&mdash;all in one graph. It helped me see just how many ways there are to interpret her beeping. For instance, every time Harry beeped more than 8 times in a second (to the right of the orange line) it was during a blue trial, and every time she beeped less than 5 beeps in a second (to the left of the blue line) it was during a not-blue trial.

But the area between the orange and blue line is possibly the most revealing part of the graph: This is the overlapping region where Harry beeped about the same number of times when she saw either type of stimuli. How ambiguous of her! On the other hand, if I found a Neuron whose responses to two different types of stimuli had no overlapping region at all, then I would be able to draw a line right in the middle to decode that Neuron's beeps perfectly every time. (And if I had found such a Neuron, believe me: Harry would be out of a job.)

Harry's beeps may encode blueness, but these results made it clear that Harry might still occasionally beep a lot when there is nothing blue, or beep very little when there is something blue. This was going to be a problem if I wanted to put on a magic show where I pretended to be able to see blue things through walls. Magicians aren't supposed to be magical on average, you know, they're supposed to be magical all the time. According to my experiment's results, if I heard Harry beep anywhere between 5 and 9 beeps I'd have no idea whether there was a blue sky outside or not.

I decided that 7 beeps in one second looked like a good rule, or _criterion_, for deciding whether or not Harry had seen something blue. But how accurate was this criterion? And is it really the best criterion possible?* I knew that my stage name as a magician was going to be "The Man Who Speaks in Beeps", but before I started putting up advertisements for my show I wanted to pick Harry's blueness criterion more carefully.
