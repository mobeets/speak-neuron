### "My Neuron is so inconsistent!"

The results from my first experiment left me just a bit disappointed. Neurons (unfortunately, including dear Envelope) tend to be extremely inconsistent creatures, and I certainly noticed this in the experiment's results. I made the graph below, called a _histogram_, to record the number of times each response beep count occurred in my experiment. [1]

What the graph shows is that even though I showed Envelope the same stimulus in the same way on each trial, he didn't always beep exactly the same number of times in response. Maybe some of the variation is due to all of the short-comings in my experimental design, but anyway most Neurons will change their minds from trial-to-trial for no reason at all. The great thing, though, is that there will still probably be an overall pattern to the results.*

	(*) If the Neuron's response beeps are extremely inconsistent, and you're sure that you've found his correct response field, you might want to take him to a doctor and get him diagnosed for being "noisy," or having a "low signal-to-noise ratio." A large percentage of Neurons will have this incurable condition. â€“WT

I was expecting to learn something concrete from this experiment. Instead, all I got was a weird looking graph with a lot of variation from trial-to-trial.

But before this experiment began I'd calculated that Envelope, as he goes about his day, is beeping an average of 15 times a second. Now, from this response histogram, it's clear that when Envelope sees broccoli he tends to beep about 9 times a second _more_ than that average. So my first experiment wasn't completely useless.
