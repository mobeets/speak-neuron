### When a Neuron isn't worth a dime

If Harry ever wants to take a vacation from performing in my magic shows, I'd have to fire her and order more Neurons until I found another one whose beeps encode blueness. But instead of listening to a Neuron's beeps to guess whether there is something blue present, what other options do I have?

I was considering just flipping a coin and guessing "blue" if the coin is heads and "not-blue" if it's tails. (A coin might be a good alternative to a Neuron, I thought, because I wouldn't have to feed a coin and give it shelter--plus they make a lot less noise.) But, as I have verified, a coin does not know anything about blueness and so a coin flip is not actually going to help me at all.

But a coin flip, being a completely unreliable signal for blueness, _can_ give me a good worst-case scenario. If it's equally likely for a stimulus to be blue or not-blue, then my accuracy rate in the long run when flipping a coin to guide my decisions would be 50%, and my incorrect rate would also be 50%. (Try it if you don't believe me.) With this in mind, a Neuron is only going to useful to me if he/she drastically outperforms a coin flip&mdash;e.g., if there is a criterion I can use with the Neuron to ensure that my accuracy rate will be well above 50% on average. Otherwise, the Neuron's beeps are no better than a coin flip.
