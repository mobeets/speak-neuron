### Neurons beep at some things more than others

All of my Neuron's beeps really overwhelmed me at first. Why did he just keep talking if he knew I couldn't understand him? We'd go out for dinner sometimes, and I always felt so awkward. He'd just talk and talk and I wouldn't say a word.

However, I soon noticed that while my Neuron never said anything interesting in English, he did seem to be communicating something. Clearly the beeps were not meant to be understood by me directly, but I had faith that my Neuron was doing more than just randomly beeping for no good reason at all.

I tried showing my Neuron my favorite pair of shoes. Then I showed him the weirdest face I knew how to make. Maybe it was my imagination but I thought I noticed an apparent mood swing in his beeps when I took away the shoes and started making the weird face. This got me thinking: What if I could show my Neuron lots of different things, and observe whether those things made my Neuron beep more often, or less?
