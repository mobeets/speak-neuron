### My Neuron will never shut up

<img id="im-2" src="images/2.jpeg">

And yet, I soon realized that having a pet Neuron was not entirely what I'd imagined. He seemed to be speaking in some sort of code. He beeped*. Continuously, sometimes, and then nothing for a bit, and then he'd beep some more. Beeping, each time with a glassy look in his eyes, almost as if he wasn't aware of the noise he was making.

(*) Neuroscientists today say that Neurons "spike," but if you put a microphone to a Neuron you will hear that "beep" is, as the author suggests, a more precise onomatopoeia than "spike" for the sound of a chattering Neuron. -WT

I became very sensitive to the incessant noise of my new friend; the endless patterns of beeps kept me up at night. I tried making wild gestures at my Neuron but he still wouldn't stop beeping. Eventually I grew desperate and bought the closest thing I could find to a Neuron handbook, Dayan and Abbott's _Theoretical Neuroscience_, and there I searched for the answers to the most fundamental questions:

* What is my Neuron saying to me? 
* What do I do? 
* When will he stop?

But the book was filled with equations and terminology that were practically as cryptic to me as my Neuron's beeps. Without some serious study, I realized, I might never form a positive relationship with my new pet.

Thankfully, I persevered. I've now had quite a few pet Neurons and I've learned a few things about Neuron-speak along the way. And yet, I've realized, people all around the world must surely be going through the same problems that I had, people with pet Neurons of their own and a now-perpetual look of confusion on their faces.

This book will not explain how to speak fluent Neuron, but it will hopefully explain the basic approach. I won't show many equations, but quite often I've realized that some simple experiments and graphs really are the best way to understand a Neuron. I will do my best to explain how a neuroscientist studies these strange creatures so that you, as pet owner, might gain some insight into the bizarre world of Neuron-speak without having to first earn a degree in neuroscience.

By the way, as for those three questions I first asked of my Neuron: The answer to my last question is, He never really stops. The answer to the question before is that you'll just have to get over it.

And as for the first question? No one actually knows. All I really know is that Neurons beep at some things more than others. But that question, as you'll see, is the key to getting to know your new pet.
