### Why your Neuron matters more than your dog

<img id="im-5" src="images/5.jpeg">

After consulting my neuroscience textbook again, Envelope's antics made a whole lot more sense. According to the textbook there are lots of things that might make a Neuron beep more than normal. It might be something abstract, like differential equations; it might be something incredibly specific, like the expression on your face when you watch television. It might be broccoli.

Dayan and Abbott call the part of a stimulus that regularly varies a Neuron's beeps its _response field_ or _receptive field_, and finding a Neuron's response field is apparently the first step to learning more about him. In other words, I was on the right track!

So each Neuron&mdash;though he may be a very talkative creature in general&mdash;will have some property, his response field, that regularly varies his beeping based on how much of it is in his environment. If that property is broccoli-ness, as it seems to be for Envelope, he will tend to beep more when he sees stimuli containing a high level of broccoli-ness.

But what is a Neuron saying about his response field? If we were to borrow an information theorist's vocabulary, we might say that a Neuron's beeps are communicating information that is encoded* in the Neuron's beeping language. In simpler words, we'd just say that a Neuron's beeps contain information about the world around them, in a form we may understand or not. As pet Neuron owners we must learn how to decode our Neuron's beeps in order to uncover this information.

The interesting thing is that dogs and cats are talkative creatures, too, but for some reason we don't think of a dog or cat as encoding information when they bark or meow. Truthfully, a dog's barks probably encode just as much information about his environment as a Neuron's beeps. But since my brain is full of Neurons and not dogs, I'm going to assume that decoding a Neuron's beeping is a much more worthwhile task than decoding a dog's barking. Plus, my dog only seems to encode information relating to the capacity of his stomach and the whereabouts of squirrels.

I've read that if you order your Neurons from the right place, you can get Neurons who beep more at straight lines, or at anything that moves to the left. And to a real neuroscientist, the dream Neuron is supposedly one who beeps the most at your grandmother&mdash;the so-called "Grandmother Neuron."* Supposedly, somewhere in the brain there's a Neuron who will beep more than usual only if he sees your grandmother: It doesn't matter what she's wearing, or if she's baking you cookies, or anything like that. She can be sitting or standing and this Neuron just doesn't care. Show him your grandma, and he'll beep like mad.
