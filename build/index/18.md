### Neuron Discrimination

Because my miss rate using Harry was higher than zero, I knew that sometimes I was going to get some guesses wrong during my magic show no matter what criterion I chose. And unfortunately, after my first performance with Harry as "The Man Who Speaks in Beeps," I definitely got the feeling my audience wasn't that impressed with some of my mistakes.

By the end of the show though, I noticed a pattern in my audience's booing: It was just the false alarm guesses (as opposed to incorrect guesses in general) that were making the audience skeptical of my supposed magical talents. I'd initially chosen a criterion for Harry's beeps that maximized my proportion correct&mdash;the accuracy rate&mdash;but that night I realized I should've instead aimed to minimize my false alarm rate. In general, I'd learned that my criterion choice might need to vary from night to night depending on what would keep each audience happy.

But if I was going to be changing my criterion every night, what I now needed was some sort of assessment to give to Harry to find my performance _overall_ at guessing blueness, rather than my hit rates and false alarms rates, which depend on the criterion I choose.

Luckily, I found in my textbook that one can measure how trustworthy a Neuron is at encoding stimuli (such as blueness) by finding something called its _discrimination_. This value gives you an idea about how well one could do at guessing the presence of a certain stimulus using the Neuron's beep count and a range of different criterions. Since it's a probability, just like the rates I calculated earlier, it can be anywhere between 0.0 (0%) and 1.0 (100%).

I went back to my Experiment 3 results and calculated H/(H+M) and FA/(FA+CR) for each trial&mdash;this gave me a hit rate (HR) and false alarm rate (FAR) at guessing blueness using each criterion. Then I graphed all of my results, with the FAR on the x-axis and the HR on the y-axis, so that each point on the plot was the false alarm rate and hit rate I got from using a certain criterion. The resulting graph is called an _ROC curve_*, and surprisingly enough, it is exactly the graph I need to find my Neuron's discrimination.

I was told, you see, that the secret to finding a Neuron's discrimination is to take the area under his ROC curve. [4] Having learned to trust this odd graph, I calculated the area under Harry's curve. It was 0.82, or 82%. This value is supposedly Harry's discrimination probability for blue stimuli. But what does this really mean?
