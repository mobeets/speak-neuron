### Using your Neuron as a broccoli-decoder, a lie detector, and so much more!

Naturally, I'm still not under the impression that Envelope necessarily cares about the size of broccoli. Neurons remind me of my jaded weatherman friend: He doesn't care much about his weather report these days but he does still give me an accurate forecast, on average, every night at 5. But unlike with weathermen, with Neurons it's not too wild of a hypothesis to suggest that a Neuron's language really is merely an encoding of his response field. Just as a weather map is written to inform people about the weather, a Neuron might exist to inform others (be they other Neurons, or its human owner) about the degree of broccoli-ness in his surroundings.

After plotting Envelope's tuning curve I could tell I was really developing as an amateur Neuron decoder. I was also a much better friend. It was at that point that I remember deciding, "Why not learn to take advantage of Envelope's talents for my own uses?"

I had a bit of a day-dreamâ€¦I imagined putting a Neuron outside my front door: I can't see what he sees, but I can still hear what he beeps. I don't like to leave the house when I don't have to, so I was imagining that there must be some way that I could know when the skies outside are blue just by listening to my Neuron's beeps. If that pet Neuron happened to have a response field of blueness, for example, then all I would need to know is the Neuron's _optimal spike count threshold_. Well, that's what my textbook called it anyway&mdash;I prefer to call it a _magic beep count_.

The magic beep count would give me a sort of rule to use to make guesses about the outside world. If my Neuron's magic beep count is 2 beeps, for example, then if I heard my Neuron beep more than 2 times in a second I'd guess that there is something really blue outside (like a cloudless sky). If he beeped less than 2 times in a second I'd conclude that there is nothing very blue outside (cloudy sky).

And that's all there is to it! The details weren't sorted out yet, but I had a gut feeling that this idea was going to make me rich. I could be a sort of magician, wowing crowds with my ability to perceive blue skies through solid walls&mdash;all with the help of my obedient little Neuron pet.
