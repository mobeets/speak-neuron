### My new pet Neuron

One morning a strange package arrived for me in the mail&mdash;the labels said it was from China and that it should remain refrigerated. I opened it up hastily, and inside I found a strange teardrop-shaped guy with tree roots coming out of his rear end.

It was my brand new pet Neuron!  I'd been waiting for this moment. I'd always wanted a pet, and I'd heard that Neurons were the computational beings responsible for human intelligence and consciousness. What good times the two of us would surely have! Two competent beings living in harmony, each with an ability to communicate our deepest, most intellectual thoughts...It would be a perfect match.
