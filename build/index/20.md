### Gardening with Neurons

Luckily for me, Neurons with other response fields and high discrimination values are good for all kinds of things besides just magic shows.
I happened to find a Neuron who beeps a lot at really ripe tomatoes, and in fact I'm now growing a tomato plant in my backyard garden. Each day when I wake up I'd like to know if there's a ripe tomato outside without having to look for myself. A false alarm would be a huge let-down, but a miss might mean the bugs get to the ripe tomato before I do. So I chose a criterion to minimize the sum of my Neuron's false alarm rate and miss rate (i.e. the incorrect rate), and then that was it! All I have to do now is listen to my Neuron and wait...
