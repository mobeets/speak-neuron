### The day I counted 661,392 beeps

Once I put on that rate coding hat, I think Envelope understood that I meant business. Well, not business&mdash;I should say friendship. But I didn't worry; I think that most Neurons should certainly respect the fact that in order to connect with a human they must be experimented upon in order to be understood.

Previously I mentioned that if a Neuron says "BEEP-SILENCE-BEEP-SILENCE-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP" I could transcribe this as "1010111." But with a rate coding Hat, all I care about the sentence "BEEP-SILENCE-BEEP-SILENCE-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP" is that it contains five beeps. Nice and simple!

So I decided to spend twelve hours of my day dedicated to counting Envelope's beeps. I carried around a clipboard and made a tally every single time Envelope beeped, which was quite a lot. Twelve hours later I'd counted 661,392 beeps. Twelve hours is 43,200 seconds, so that means Envelope beeped, on average, just over 15 times a second.

It was a crazy day, but now I knew Envelope's average beep count. After our incident together with the broccoli I suspected that Envelope was beeping more at broccoli than at other things, but at the time I couldn't really prove it. Now I'd be able to test that belief for sure.
