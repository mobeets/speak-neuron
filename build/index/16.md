### Finding the best criterion

If I used 7 beeps per second as my criterion, then whenever Harry beeped more than 7 times in one second I'd guess that she saw something blue. If she beeped more than 7 times and the stimulus really _was_ something blue then that guess is called a _hit_, because it's a correct guess that a blue stimulus was present. But if she saw a blue stimulus and beeped _less_ than 7 times then my guess would be a _miss_. Here's a chart of all the possibilities:

The best criterion for decoding blueness using a Neuron's beeps is only a guessing-game away. Here's the recipe:

1. Start your experiment using a criterion of 0 beeps.
2. Go through the Neuron's results to the last experiment and classify trials where she beeped more than the criterion as a guess that the stimulus was blue, and trials where she beeped less than the criterion as a guess that the stimulus was not-blue.
3. Compare the guesses on each trial with the actual stimulus on each trial, classifying each guess as either a hit, miss, false alarm, or a correct rejection.
4. How many hits (H), misses (M), correct rejections (CR), and false alarms (FA) were there in total? Tally these counts for each criterion.
5. Use a criterion of 1 beep and repeat steps 1-4.
6. Use a criterion of 2 beeps and repeat steps 1-4.
7. Use a criterion of X beeps and repeat steps 1-4, etc. etc.

I could now calculate a variety of different rates for each of my criterion (using the results from the experiment above):

* hit rate = H/(H+M)
* correct rejection rate = CR/(FA+CR)
* false alarm rate = FA/(FA+CR)
* miss rate = M/(H+M)
* accuracy rate = (H+CR)/(H+CR+FA+M)
* incorrect rate = (FA+M)/(H+CR+FA+M)

If I decided that I wanted my criterion for Harry to maximize the number of times that I can correctly guess "Harry saw something blue," I'd pick the criterion that gives me the highest hit rate. If I wanted to maximize the number of times I can guess correctly blue _or_ not-blue, I'd use the criterion with the highest accuracy rate. [3]
