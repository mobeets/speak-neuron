### Finding the best criterion

If I use 7 beeps per second as my criterion, then whenever Harry beeps more than that I'd guess that she saw something blue. If the stimulus really is blue then that guess is called a _hit_, because it's a correct guess that a blue stimulus was present. On the other hand, if the stimulus wasn't actually blue then my guess is called a _false positive_. Here's a chart of all the possibilities:

To test how good a certain criterion is you can use trials from the last experiment to guess the stimulus using only your Neuron's beep count and the criterion. (The guessing rule: Did she beep more than the criterion? Blue. Less? Not-blue.) Now just count the number of times you got a hit, a miss, a correct rejection, and a false alarm.

To give a criterion an overall score, we just need to combine those counts into a single number, or rate. The _accuracy rate_ is the number of times you guessed the stimulus correctly (i.e. a hit or a correct rejection) divided by the total number of trials. The _hit rate_ is the number of times you guessed there was a blue stimulus divided by the number of times a blue stimulus was actually present. Below is a list of common rates you might consider calculating:

* hit rate = H/(H+M)
* correct rejection rate = CR/(FA+CR)
* false alarm rate = FA/(FA+CR)
* miss rate = M/(H+M)
* accuracy rate = (H+CR)/(H+CR+FA+M)
* incorrect rate = (FA+M)/(H+CR+FA+M)

Different rates are useful depending on what's most important. If I want to maximize the number of times my guess is correct, I'd use the criterion with the highest accuracy rate. Or if I just want my criterion to maximize the number of times that I can detect when Harry sees something blue, I'd pick the criterion that gives me the highest hit rate.

So the best criterion for decoding a stimulus using a Neuron's beeps is only a few guessing-games away: Once you've chosen what's most important to you, you just have to try out every criterion until you find the one that maximizes the right rate. [3]
