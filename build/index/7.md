### Neurons beep at some things more than others (continued)

After my broccoli dinner I decided that just because Envelope beeps more when he sees broccoli, it doesn't mean that he _likes_ broccoli. It doesn't even mean that he prefers it! How can I know that he isn't merely annoyed by all my stupid broccoli? And as tempting as it is, I don't feel comfortable making any statements about a Neuron's opinion towards the things he beeps at; all I can really say is whether he's beeping more or less than usual. 

But who really cares what Envelope actually wants to tell me? Ultimately, a Neuron's beeps might contain useful information about the world around us&mdash;whether that's the Neuron's intent or not. Maybe this sounds inconsiderate. But consider the following hypothetical conversation (I'll translate the beeps to English for your sake):

<div class="note">
YOU: Hey Neuron, what's up?

NEURON: Hello. I went to the grocery store yesterday. Before the grocery store exploded I bought some green beans.
</div>

Neurons, as you might imagine, come from a culture very unlike human culture. In the conversation above the Neuron only wanted you to know that he bought some green beans; but you, on the other hand, were presumably much more interested in learning that the grocery store exploded. On that note, let's move forward with the awareness that what we learn about our Neurons' beeps will, unfortunately, not necessarily be what they intend to tell us at all.
