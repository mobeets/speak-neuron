### Beep.

I would need to design an experiment, I realized, to keep things in order. If I wanted to see whether my Neuron was beeping more or less I would need to start counting his beeps. But what is a beep, really?

After a bit of observation&mdash;and after a few re-reads of the first chapter of my neuroscience textbook&mdash;it became apparent that each Neuron beep is essentially identical to the others. This means that if a Neuron is trying to communicate something with us humans then the only thing that changes in his speech is how frequently he beeps. Call it his beep rate, spike rate&mdash;whatever, it doesn't matter. The only important thing to understand is that a Neuron communicates thoughts in an entirely different way than we do.

Each word a human says means something different, and it doooeesssn't.....mattttter.............whenyousay...each word. But a Neuron only knows the word "BEEP," and so if he wants to communicate something he can only vary when or how much he beeps.

But if a Neuron's beeps are identical, wouldn't it be possible that my Neuron is speaking in silences, too? Instead of my Neuron saying "BEEP...BEEPBEEP......BEEP," for example, maybe he's actually saying "BEEP-SILENCE-BEEP-BEEP-SILENCE-SILENCE-BEEP." Truly, as I once read in a famous book on Neurons, "Silence speaks as well as words."*

So a Neuron knows two words, BEEP and SILENCE. We can transcribe Neuron-speak, then, as a string of zeros and ones. A "1" means that the Neuron beeped at a certain time, and a "0" means he didn't. I can now write "BEEP-SILENCE-BEEP-BEEP-SILENCE-SILENCE-BEEP" as "1011001." It turns out that a lot of people, including dear old Dayan and Abbott from my textbook, like to transcribe Neuron-speak in this binary* form.

(*) A binary alphabet allows one to distinguish between two different things&mdash;in this case, between a BEEP and a SILENCE. Morse code, on the other hand, could be represented as a quaternary language: it lets one distinguish between four different sounds&mdash;the characters "dah" and "dit" and two types of silences. -WT
