### A quick story about my first Neuron

<img id="im-4" src="images/4.jpeg">

Shortly after my first hunch that my Neuron could be beeping at some things more than others, I had another stroke of insight. I was hanging out with my Neuron&mdash;I found a little card in the box he came in that said his name was "Envelope"&mdash;and I was surely wondering how in the world I was ever going to become friends with an opinionated pet with a two-word vocabulary.

It was dinner time, and I was about to cook some veggies. Envelope was sitting on the kitchen counter beeping at what seemed to be his normal rate, but then I brought out a piece of green broccoli and he just started going mad. What I mean to say is: He started beeping more than ever before! 

I was confused at first...I put down the broccoli and ran over to him, stroking his dendrites*. "Envelope, what's wrong?" No response. In fact, the moment I'd set down the broccoli he resumed beeping normally. But once I went back to the counter, picked up the broccoli and started chopping it, Envelope again went nuts!

(*) Dendrites are like a Neuron's hair&mdash;only dendrites also conduct electricity. A Neuron is in fact deaf to the beeping of any other Neuron unless he touches a dendrite to the other Neuron's leg, aka axon. -WT

I decided at first to just ignore him (I was kind of angry with him that day; earlier I was trying to listen to my favorite Archure song and Envelope had insisted on sitting in my lap and beeping right in my ear the entire time), but I wasn't in the best mood so I eventually decided to sort of taunt him with the broccoli. I chopped the broccoli into smaller and smaller pieces, and each time I made the broccoli smaller I made sure to show Envelope how tiny his precious broccoli was getting: "How about that, you strange Neuron!" I yelled.

The really strange thing, though, was that Envelope's frantic beeping slowed regularly as I made the broccoli smaller and smaller. In the end, when the broccoli was finally torn to crumbs, Envelope was beeping at his normal rate again, apparently unfazed by all my antics.

I felt kind of stupid having wasted a huge chunk of produce teasing a Neuron, but eventually I calmed down and picked up another piece of broccoli to start chopping for dinner. Envelope could see it, though, and he started beeping madly again! And that's when it finally hit me: Envelope had something to say about broccoli.
