### Conclusion

<img id="im-19" src="images/19.jpeg">

Getting to know my Neurons was tough, as it essentially required learning a new language. It's forced me to reconsider what it really means to communicate and make decisions, as well as how difficult it can be to understand what someone else means. But perhaps more imporantly, it's made me rich. "The Man Who Speaks in Beeps" is now an international sensation.*

Envelope and I, we've tried many different ways of understanding each other and they've all been helpful; when we go out to dinner now there aren't so many awkward silences. As for Harry, we rarely go out to dinner because she doesn't beep much at the restaurants I pick*. (She's not much into socializing, anyway&mdash;she takes our magic performances very seriously and is trying valiantly to get her blueness discrimination up to 90% so we can take our show to Vegas.) But my ripe-tomato Neuron friend has been of no use to me yet. He hasn't ever beeped above the criterion I chose for him: Still no ripe tomatoes in my garden, apparently.

(*) The author evidently noticed that if one finds a stimulus with the exact opposite of a Neuron's response field, it will usually have an inhibitive effect on the Neuron, causing him or her to beep far less than average. At the time the author wrote this book in 2012, anti-broccoli did not yet exist. Orange restaurants, on the other hand, did. And so by taking his Neuron Harry to orange restaurants the author was finally able to answer his question "When will he stop [beeping]?" The answer: Show him an inhibitive stimulus. -WT

I hope that after reading all of this you're feeling a little better about your Neuron friend and how to approach its endless beeping. So far I've explained how to find a Neuron's response field, how to wear a rate coding hat, how to choose a criterion for decoding your Neuron's beeps, and how to grade your Neuron's overall helpfulness at discriminating between two different stimuli. But there are many more ways to find something of interest in your Neuron's beeps. Most likely, no one's even thought of the best ways yet.

Learning to understand a Neuron pet may be a handy skill, but there's still a lot more we can aim for. After all, human consciousness itself may be nothing more than a collection of beeping Neurons, each one encoding some relevant part of our surroundings. If so much can be gained from listening to a single Neuron in isolation, just imagine the multitude of information gained from understanding a network of Neurons communicating with each other!*

Since I can easily tell when it's cold enough outside to put on a scarf, something in my brain must know how to decode all the beeps of the relevant Neurons to give me my decision. Whether or not there's really a magic beep count for discriminating things like coldness or scarf-time, it is certainly possible that only by the collective responses of my Neurons am I able to take a step outside and make any decision at all&mdash;most importantly, "Hey, I should put on my scarf." Who knows?
