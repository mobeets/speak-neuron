### Conclusion

<img id="im-19" src="images/19.jpeg">

Getting to know my Neurons was tough at times, and it essentially required learning a new language. But it's made me think a lot about what it means to really communicate and make decisions, as well as how difficult it can sometimes be to understand what someone else means. (Also, it's made me rich. "The Man Who Speaks in Beeps" is now an international sensation.*)

Envelope and I, we've tried many different ways of understanding each other and they've all been helpful. Now when we go out to dinner there aren't so many awkward silences. And as for Harry, we rarely go out to dinner because she doesn't beep much at the restaurants I pick*. (Anyway, she takes our magic performances very seriously and is trying valiantly to get her blueness discrimination up to 90% so we can take our show to Vegas.) But my ripe-tomato Neuron friend, he's been of no use to me yet. He hasn't ever beeped above the criterion I chose for him: Still no ripe tomatoes in my garden, apparently.

(*) The author evidently noticed that if one finds the exact opposite of what a Neuron beeps a lot at, that stimulus will usually have an inhibitive effect&mdash;meaning it will make the Neuron beep far less than average. At the time the author wrote this book in 2012, anti-broccoli did not yet exist. Orange restaurants, on the other hand, did. And so by taking his Neuron Harry to orange restaurants the author was finally able to answer his question "When will he stop [beeping]?" The answer: Show him an inhibitive stimulus. -WT

I hope that after reading all this you're feeling a little better about your Neuron friend and how to approach its endless beeping. So far I've explained how to find a Neuron's response field, how to wear a rate coding hat, how to choose a criterion for decoding a Neuron, and how to grade your Neuron's overall helpfulness at discriminating between two different stimuli. There are so many more ways of finding something of interest in your Neuron's beeps, and most likely no one's even thought of the best ways yet.

While learning to understand a Neuron pet may be a handy skill occasionally, there's still a lot more we can aim for. After all, our brains are full of Neurons, and each one of those beeping guys seems to be encoding something useful just like my pet Neurons do. In fact, most people believe that human consciousness is nothing more than a collection of beeping Neurons. If so much can be gained from listening to a single Neuron in isolation, just imagine the multitude of information gained from a network of Neurons communicating to each other!*

Since I can easily tell if it's cold enough outside to put on a scarf, something in my brain must know how to decode all the beeping of the relevant Neurons in my brain to give me my decision. Whether or not there's really a magic beep count for the Neurons in my brain who discriminate things like coldness or scarf-time, it is certainly possible that only by the collective responses of my Neurons am I able to take a step outside and make any decision at all&mdash;most importantly, "Hey, I should put on my scarf." Who knows?
