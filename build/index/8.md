### Why we wear hats

Once I recognized that Envelope beeped more at broccoli we became a whole lot closer. But knowing what someone talks about is only the first step to getting to know him! I decided to start designing some experiments, like they did in my textbook, and that's when things got interesting.

So, I thought, a Neuron can only adjust the times that he beeps and not the style of the beeps themselves. Then that means I can record a Neuron's speech either by noting the exact times he decides to beep (this will require a very expensive digital watch) or the number of times he beeps in a fixed amount of time (this only requires that I know how to count very quickly, which I do).

In the back of my textbook there were some photos of Dayan, Abbott, and their friends. According to those photos, most people who study Neurons wear hats. First there's the _rate coding hat_, and when you wear that hat it means you only care about how many times your Neurons beep. But if you prefer to record the precise beep times of your Neurons you wear a _sombrero_*. Since counting sounded easier than taking precise time measurements (and my watch isn't digital, anyway) I decided to buy myself a rate coding hat.
