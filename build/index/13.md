### Experiment 2: Tuning your Neuron

<img id="im-10" src="images/10.jpeg">

Despite Envelope's inconsistent beeping in the first broccoli experiment I still wanted to go a bit further and see what else I could find. In particular, I had a hunch that big broccoli would make him beep more than small broccoli.

In the next experiment I used the same general strategy as before: I wore a rate coding hat, I showed my Neuron a stimulus, and I recorded his responses. But this time I varied the stimulus size on every trial to see how Envelope changed his beeps in response. Instead of just using the same piece of broccoli on every trial, I gathered a bucket full of variously sized broccolis.

I figured that since stimuli with a high value in a Neuron's response field are supposed to regularly alter his beeping, then if I showed Envelope lots of different sizes of broccoli and each one of them made him beep differently, I could be pretty confident that Envelope's beeps were encoding broccoli size.

I really felt like I was onto something, with my bucket full of broccoli and my experimental set-up and my rate coding hat. (I even had a dream that I was recognized as the world's leading Neuron decoder.) But really, scientist or not, anyone can learn something about the world just by listening carefully to a Neuron.

So I took Envelope out of his cage* and showed him the same broccoli as I did in my first experiment, exactly the same way each time. But then, after each trial I randomly chose a broccoli of a different size (I wanted the stimulus size change to be random, so he wouldn't know what to expect next) to use for the next trial.

Recipe:

1. Gather a bucket of stimuli, where each stimulus in the bucket has a different value in your Neuron's response field.*
2. Tie up your Neuron.
3. Close your eyes and pick a stimulus from your bucket of stimuli. Show your Neuron that stimulus for one second, and count the number of times he beeps in response.
4. Now, put the stimulus back in your stimulus bucket and randomly choose a new stimulus from your stimulus bucket. Show him the stimulus for one second, record his beep count, etc.
5. Repeat step 3 until you have used each one of your stimuli on many different trials.

(*) The author has neglected to mention explicitly that your stimuli should be in some way represented by a numerical value. Since Envelope's response field is broccoli size, each stimulus is seen as having a unique level of broccoli-ness, as measured by its diameter. It is unclear how the author might have suggested quantifying other response fields, such as Grandma-ness. -WT

After this experiment I had about ten trials for each stimulus, and in each trial I counted my Neuron's beep count as his response. I made a big graph of all this data using the broccoli diameter measured in inches as the x-axis and his beep counts above his average  beep count as the y-axis. Each dot in this graph is one of Envelope's responses I measured during one trial.

I should mention that I can't actually claim all the credit for these experiment ideas. After all, at this point I still couldn't decipher anything in my neuroscience textbook past about page sixteen. But why I really wanted to do this experiment was to help me build for Envelope was what's called a _tuning curve_ for his response field.

All I needed to do now was take the average number of beeps Envelope emitted to each stimulus of my last experiment, and then draw a curve through those average values. [2]

After making this tuning curve, Envelope's beeping looked so consistently predicted by the broccoli size that it felt like I was cracking the Voynich manuscript or something. Look at that trend line! "Envelope!" I yelled. "I know why my caged Neuron beeps!"

Of course, in my excitement I was mistaken. (Possibly I was just being dramatic.) Since most Neurons only seem to have one response field each, many people assume that a Neuron beeps because his beeps are constantly encoding the magnitude of his response field in his environment.* But really, I still don't know why my Neuron beeps. In my opinion, all I've really learned is a way to regularly vary his average beep rate.
