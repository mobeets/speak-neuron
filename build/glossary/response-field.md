A property whose magnitude in the Neuron's environment will, when varied, regularly affect the Neuron's beeping.

Example: When the wind blows from the North, my Neuron beeps much more than average. When the wind is not blowing at all he beeps normally. When the wind blows from the South he beeps much less than average. My Neuron's response field seems to be the "Northness-of-the-wind."
