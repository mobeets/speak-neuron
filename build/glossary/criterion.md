In the context of Neuron decoding, a criterion is a threshold used to decide the answer to a question with two possible answers using only the Neuron's beep count.

Example: I decide that whenever Harry beeps less than 5 times in a second I will blink my right eye. If he beeps more than 5 times in a second I will blink my left eye. My criterion for deciding which eye to blink is then "5 beeps per second."
